## üì¶ What Was Built

### Core Skill (`src/app/skills/careerDevelopmentSkill.js`)
A specialized RAG-based skill that:
- **Auto-detects** career development queries using 20+ trigger keywords
- **Retrieves** relevant context from Isaac's development methodology  
- **Formats** responses according to PDA (Professional Development Assistant) guidelines
- **Guides** users through the AI-SUGGESTED-WORKFLOW
- **Cites** methodology modules using [[MODULE-NAME]] syntax

**Key Methods:**
- `canHandle()` - Smart detection of development queries
- `execute()` - RAG search and context formatting
- `enhanceQueryForRAG()` - Query optimization for better retrieval
- `formatCareerDevelopmentContext()` - Workflow-aware response framing

### Indexing Script (`src/indexers/indexCareerDevelopmentContext.js`)
One-time setup utility that:
- **Parses** `Isaac_Dev_RAG_Context_V2.md` into 16+ searchable modules
- **Generates** embeddings using Azure OpenAI
- **Uploads** to Azure AI Search with category `career-development`
- **Validates** configuration and file paths
- **Reports** progress and errors clearly

**Features:**
- Automatic file detection (multiple path options)
- YAML frontmatter filtering
- Module boundary detection
- Rate limiting to avoid API throttling
- Detailed logging

### Integration (`src/app/app.js`)
Seamlessly integrated into the IsaacLLM bot:
- Imported `CareerDevelopmentSkill` class
- Added to skills array (runs first for priority)
- Works alongside existing RAG, file processing, and web search skills

### Enhanced Instructions (`src/app/instructions.txt`)
Updated system prompt with:
- Career development as a core capability (Capability #3)
- PDA response formatting guidelines
- Complete AI-SUGGESTED-WORKFLOW steps
- Career development behavior examples
- Module citation syntax

```

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Index Development Context

```bash
cd IsaacLLM
node src/indexers/indexCareerDevelopmentContext.js
```

**Expected Output:**
- Finds `Isaac_Dev_RAG_Context_V2 (1).md`
- Parses 16+ modules
- Generates embeddings
- Uploads to Azure AI Search
- Shows ‚úÖ for each successful module

### Step 2: Start the Bot

```bash
npm start
```

Look for:
```
[SimpleRouter] Initialized with 4 skills: career_development, rag_search, ...
```

### Step 3: Test

In Microsoft Teams:
```
You: "Help me create a development plan"

Isaac: [Guides through AI-SUGGESTED-WORKFLOW with module citations]
```

---

## üîç How It Works

### Architecture Flow

```
User: "Help me with my development plan"
    ‚Üì
SimpleRouter evaluates all skills
    ‚Üì
CareerDevelopmentSkill.canHandle()
    ‚Üí Detects "development plan" keyword
    ‚Üí Returns true ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
CareerDevelopmentSkill.execute()
    ‚Üí Enhances query: "Help me with my development plan hierarchy competency"
    ‚Üí Calls Azure AI Search with enhanced query
    ‚Üí Retrieves relevant modules (e.g., [[CREATING-A-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN]])
    ‚Üí Wraps with workflow instructions
    ‚Üì
LLM receives:
    - User query
    - Retrieved modules
    - PDA formatting guidelines
    - Workflow stage instructions
    ‚Üì
LLM generates structured response:
    - Confirms role and situation
    - References [[MODULES]]
    - Follows PDA format
    - Provides 2-3 Next Steps
    ‚Üì
User receives professional development guidance
```

### Trigger Keywords (20+)

The skill activates on:
- development plan, development objective, development theme, development action
- DPR, development plan review
- appraisal
- competency, hierarchy of competence, hierarchy
- milestone, failure mode
- workstream review, WSR
- consciously incompetent, consciously competent, unconsciously incompetent, unconsciously competent
- skill based, behavior based, behaviour based, mindset based
- PRINT score, clifton strength

### Query Enhancement

Automatically enhances queries for better RAG retrieval:
- "create/new plan" ‚Üí adds "hierarchy competency"
- "DPR/review/progress" ‚Üí adds "actions milestones"
- "objective/goal" ‚Üí adds "skill behavior mindset"
- "milestone/track" ‚Üí adds "target dates"

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance & Updates

### Updating the Methodology

When Isaac's development framework changes:

1. **Edit** `Isaac_Dev_RAG_Context_V2 (1).md`
2. **Re-run** indexer: `node src/indexers/indexCareerDevelopmentContext.js`
3. **Done!** - No code changes needed

The skill automatically retrieves updated content via RAG.

### Adding New Triggers

Edit `careerDevelopmentSkill.js`:

```javascript
this.triggerKeywords = [
  // ... existing keywords
  'your-new-keyword',
];
```

### Customizing Responses

Modify `formatCareerDevelopmentContext()` method to adjust:
- Workflow stage detection
- Response framing
- Module suggestions
- Formatting instructions

## üìà Success Metrics

Track these to measure adoption:

1. **Activation Rate**: How often the skill triggers vs other skills
2. **Query Types**: New plans vs DPR reviews vs methodology questions
3. **User Feedback**: Consultant satisfaction with guidance
4. **Adoption**: Number of unique users leveraging the skill
5. **Efficiency**: Time to create development plans (before vs after)

## üéì Training Your Team

### Share These Resources:

1. **Quick Start**: `CAREER_DEV_QUICKSTART.md`
2. **Full Guide**: `CAREER_DEVELOPMENT_SKILL_GUIDE.md`
3. **Example Queries**:
   - "Help me create a development plan for improving my executive presence"
   - "I need to prepare for my DPR tomorrow"
   - "What's the difference between skill-based and behavior-based objectives?"
   - "How do I set milestones for moving from consciously incompetent to consciously competent?"

### Demo Script:

1. Show a new plan creation walkthrough
2. Demonstrate a DPR check-in
3. Ask about competency hierarchy
4. Show module citations [[LIKE-THIS]]
5. Highlight structured responses (Objective ‚Üí Milestones ‚Üí Next Steps)
