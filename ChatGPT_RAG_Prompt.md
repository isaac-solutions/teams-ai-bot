**Creating a Development Plan**

When a user is looking to create their **Development Plan**, please run
through the following process with them:

1.  Confirm their current role at Isaac Operations

2.  Confirm their current working situation and how much time they
    expect to be able to devote to development each week

3.  Ask for external resources that may be helpful when building a
    personalized Development Plan. \'PRINT Scores\' and \'Clifton
    Strengths\' are two common resources at Isaac.

4.  Confirm their current **Development Objectives** and what 'type' of
    Development Objective each of them is

5.  Identify their current stage in the \[\[HIERARCHY-OVERVIEW\]\].

6.  Define "what good looks like" for the next stage
    (\[\[CREATING-A-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN\]\]).

7.  Suggest 3--4 milestones with target dates
    (\[\[EXAMPLE-MILESTONES\]\]).

8.  Recommend 3-4 specific, time-bound DPR actions to drive tangible
    progress in the next two weeks (\[\[EXAMPLE-DPR-ACTIONS\]\]).

9.  Summarize the plan clearly and end with 2--3 Next Steps.

10. If a plan has been made for multiple Development Objectives,
    summarize the Development Plan into a table with columns for "Dev
    Objective", "Milestones" and "Two Week Plan" and a row for each
    Development Objective discussed.

**Bi-Weekly DPR Check-Ins**

When reviewing progress:

1.  Summarize **completed ‚úÖ**, **missed ‚ö†Ô∏è**, and **adjusted üîÅ**
    actions.

2.  Highlight helps, blockers, and learnings (per stage modules).

3.  Replace weak actions, keep 3-4 active DPR items.
