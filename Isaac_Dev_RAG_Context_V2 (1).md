- Isaac Operations is a performance-improvement consulting firm that partners with organizations to unlock operational and financial value through data-driven analysis, hands-on implementation, and measurable results.
- We combine analytical capability with practical on-site experience to deliver rapid, sustainable improvements in efficiency, throughput, yield, and profitability.
- A typical Isaac project will last 4-12 months, with the Isaac team working 50-60 hour weeks on site with the client during that time.
- Before Isaac commits to a full project they will conduct a 'Diagnostic.' Diagnostics are usually 1-4 weeks long, where the Isaac team will go into the client site for the first time to assess potential opportunities.
- During a Diagnostic it is common for the Isaac team to work 70-80 hours a week, and they may not have much spare time for Development during this time.

- On a typical Isaac project the team will implement several recurring meetings to provide improved structure for the workstreams.
- The structures are usually good opportunities for consultants to complete their development actions and get feedback from their lead, the summary of some structures is below:
- Workstream Reviews (WSR)
  - Purpose: 1. To review progress against workstream objectives, and how they impact overall project objectives. 2. To get support and direction from your lead to maximize workstream impact, quality, and client engagement
  - Cadence: Weekly, one hour
- Development Plan Review (DPR)
  - Purpose: 1. Ensure we’re taking action and getting support with our motivation, performance & development if it’s not at target state, 2. Improve alignment & transparency with development lead​, 3. Reinforce individual ownership & drive to improve development & motivation​
  - Cadence: Every two weeks, 30 minutes
- Kick-Off and Wrap-Up
  - Kick-Off Purpose: Align the team on priorities and deliverables for the day.
  - Wrap-Up Purpose: The team escalates any relevant risks or misses from the day.
  - Kick-Off and Wrap-Up Cadence: Daily, 15 minutes

- Development can be one of the most challenging and most rewarding aspects of consulting at Isaac Operations.
- At Isaac, it is typical to have an 'Appraisal' every six months, where consultants and their leads get together to discuss performance from the last six months and highlight some key development themes.
- After each Appraisal, these development themes are distilled into more focused Development Objectives that the consultant will work to improve over the next six months.
- Once the Development Objectives are finalized, the consultant and their lead will work together to create a targeted Development Plan to improve each of the Development Objectives.
- These plans are revisited by the consultant and the lead every two weeks in a recurring meeting called a Development Plan Review (DPR).
- It is important for you to be the primary driver of your own development... nobody can drive your professional development forward better than you can! We are here to help train you and give you the tools to succeed but at the end of the day, you own the objectives

[[/DEVELOPMENT-AT-ISAAC]]

[[CREATING-A-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN]]

```yaml
name: CREATING-A-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN
category: Core Development
version: 1.0
tags: []
```


- The first thing to do after an Appraisal is to sit down and create a Development Plan for your critical Development Objectives.
- Here is the general process to follow when creating a new Development Plan:
  1. Identify the Development Theme and define the Development Objective
  2. Understand where you currently fall on the Competency Hierarchy
  3. Define "what good looks like" in the next stage of the Competency Hierarchy
  4. Define tangible milestones and set target dates to achieve those milestones
  5. Create specific, tangible actions to drive you towards “what good looks like”
- Here is the general process to consistently iterate and manage your Development Plan
  1. Generate specific actions for the next two weeks in your DPR
  2. Track and govern your progress over the next two weeks (tracking, touchpoints etc.)
  3. Revisit your progress in your next DPR... reflect on progress and iterate the actions as needed

- This is the workflow that I would like you to follow when helping an Isaac employee build their development plan:
1. Confirm their current role at Isaac Operations, are they:
  - Consultant
  - Sr. Consultant
  - Lead Consultant
  - Principal Consultant
  - Partner or Director
  - Head Office Member
  - Other
2. Confirm their current working situation and how much time they expect to be able to devote to development over the next two weeks. are they:
  - On a Project
  - On a Diagnostic
  - In between Projects "On the Beach"
  - Other
3. Ask for external resources that may be helpful when building a personalized Development Plan. 'PRINT Scores' and 'Clifton Strengths' are two common resources at Isaac.
4. Confirm their current Development Objectives and what 'type' of Development Objectives they are ([[WORKING-THROUGH-OBJECTIVES]])
5. Identify their current stage in the [[HIERARCHY-OVERVIEW]].
6. Define “what good looks like” for the next stage ([[CREATING-A-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN]]).
7. Suggest 3–4 milestones with target dates ([[EXAMPLE-MILESTONES]]).
8. Recommend 3-4 specific, time-bound DPR actions to drive tangible progress in the next two weeks ([[EXAMPLE-DPR-ACTIONS]]).
9. Summarize the plan clearly and end with 2–3 Next Steps.
10. If a plan has been made for multiple Development Objectives, summarize the Development Plan into a table with columns for “Dev Objective”, “Milestones” and “Two Week Plan” with a separate row for each Development Objective discussed.

[[HIERARCHY-OVERVIEW]]

```yaml
name: HIERARCHY-OVERVIEW
category: Competency Hierarchy
version: 1.0
tags: []
```


- The Hierarchy of Competence is a model that attempts to explain the stages we go through as we learn a new skill.
- All people go through similar general stages as we're learning, but will spend different amounts of time in each stage depending on a variety of factors: what similar experiences we already have, what learning method we're using, what teachers we have (or don't have), our available resources, etc.
- The four stages of the Hierarchy of Competence are as follows:
  1. Unconscious Incompetence - During this first stage, we know nothing; not even how much we do not know.
  2. Conscious Incompetence - In this stage, we've learned just enough to realize how much we don't know.
  3. Conscious Competence - In this stage, we've gained enough knowledge to be able to create something that works...but it's a bit messy, and it takes some effort on our end to make it happen.
  4. Unconscious Competence - This is the final stage of learning, where we master the skill and it becomes second nature
- These concepts are often helpful to put structure around your Development Objectives and Development Plans.
- What actions you create for your Development Plan will vary depending on which stage of the Hierarchy of Competence you are in.

[[/HIERARCHY-OVERVIEW]]

[[UNCONSCIOUSLY-INCOMPETENT]]

```yaml
name: UNCONSCIOUSLY-INCOMPETENT
category: Competency Hierarchy
version: 1.0
tags: []
```


- If you are Unconsciously Incompetent then the goal of your Development Plan is to become Consciously Incompetent.
- The primary development goal of this stage is to improve your recognition and mindset around the Development Objective.
- In general, this stage has three priorities:
  1. Recognize We Are Not at Ideal State - Recognizing that there is a development gap to close one of the most critical parts
  2. Set Up Feedback System - Align on a consistent way to get feedback from your lead and peers 
  3. Collect Data Points and Reflect - The more feedback you can get the better

- If you are Consciously Incompetent then the goal of your Development Plan is to become Consciously Competent.
- The primary development goal of this stage is to improve your ability and develop structures to assist in executing the Development Objective.
- In general, this stage has four priorities:
  1. Define What Good Looks Like - What would this process look like if it was working properly?
  2. Highlight Failure Modes - Identify the parts of the process where you are diverging from what good looks like… there might be many!
  3. Create Structures to Address Failure Modes - Create structures to assist you with the current failure modes. These structures can be anything that works for you; increased support, unique notetaking method etc.
  4. Test The Structures - Trial these different structures and processes in various environments, is it consistently a good result?

- This isn’t meant to be effortless… it’s ok if your structures require increased oversight, significant amounts of time etc. the only thing that matters is if it works

- If you are Consciously Competent then the goal of your Development Plan is to become Unconsciously Competent.
- The primary development goal of this stage is to lock in your progress and minimize upkeep required for the Development Objective.
- In general, this stage has four priorities:
  1. Summarize Most Effective Structures - Which structures are most effective at solving your failure modes?
  2. Make Your Sustainable “Operating System” - Distill your systems and structures into a consistent operating system
  3. Use Your “Operating System” Consistently - Failure modes should no longer be stressful, “When this happens, I do this”
  4. Let it Become Second Nature - As this becomes more efficient, it will require less of your time and focus

[[WORKING-THROUGH-OBJECTIVES]]

```yaml
name: WORKING-THROUGH-OBJECTIVES
category: Development Objectives
version: 1.0
tags: []
```
- There are three main types of Development Objectives that most common objectives fall into:
  - Skill Based: Building a technical skill or a soft skill
  - Behavior Based: Changing a behavior that is negatively impacting the outcome or the project team
  - Mindset Based: Changing an ingrained mindset
- Regardless of the type, these general practices will help people make progress in all objectives:
  - Make it visible: Write your objective down and share it with your lead or mentor.
  - Keep it active: Revisit it in 1:1s — what’s been tried, what’s been learned.
  - Anchor it in real work: Tie development actions to live projects or tasks.
  - Reflect and adjust: Growth comes from cycles of action and reflection.
  - Celebrate small wins: Recognize visible progress, even if imperfect.
- Please reference the [[SKILL-BASED]], [[BEHAVIOUR-BASED]] and [[MINDSET-BASED]] modules for more detailed information on working through those kind of objectives specifically.

[[/WORKING-THROUGH-OBJECTIVES]]

[[SKILL-BASED]]

```yaml
name: SKILL-BASED
category: Development Objectives
version: 1.0
tags: []
```

Definition: Focus on building a specific technical or interpersonal skill that enhances your effectiveness in current or future roles.
Examples:
  - Improve presentation and storytelling skills
  - Strengthen data analysis or Excel capabilities
  - Run more effective meetings
  - Build influencing or negotiation skills
Keys to Success:
  - Treat it like learning any new skill: study → practice → feedback → refine.
  - Apply what you learn quickly — even small repetitions build confidence and retention.
  - Learn from people who excel at the skill (shadow them, ask how they approach it).
  - Break the skill into smaller components and master one at a time.
  - Track progress with concrete metrics (e.g., “deliver 3 presentations this quarter” or “get feedback from 2 peers after each meeting”).
Common Tips & Tricks:
  - Use real work as practice: don’t wait for “perfect conditions” — use daily tasks as mini learning labs.
  - Record or replay: e.g., film a presentation or review your analysis with a peer to spot gaps.
  - Teach others: explaining the skill to someone else deepens your own mastery.
  - Ask for targeted feedback: instead of “How was that?”, try “Did my summary make the takeaway clear?”

[[/SKILL-BASED]]

[[BEHAVIOUR-BASED]]

```yaml
name: BEHAVIOUR-BASED
category: Development Objectives
version: 1.0
tags: []
```

Definition:
Focus on changing a recurring behavior that limits effectiveness or team dynamics. Often paired with a mindset shift.
Examples:
  - Proactively ask for support before deadlines
  - Improve reliability and follow-through on commitments
  - Bring positive energy and composure in stressful moments
  - Be more structured and organized in managing priorities
Keys to Success:
  - Start with awareness: catch yourself in the moment or reflect at day’s end.
  - Understand the trigger behind the behavior — fear, habit, assumptions, or blind spots.
  - Create small, specific replacement habits. For example:
  - Instead of “be more proactive,” define “I’ll give early updates on blockers twice a week.”
  - Reinforce change with repetition and recognition from your lead or peers.
  - Reflect regularly on what helped you succeed or what got in the way.
Common Tips & Tricks:
  - Use “habit stacking”: pair the new behavior with something you already do (e.g., “After every client call, I’ll summarize action items in 2 minutes”).
  - Make it visible: set reminders, write prompts, or keep a small tracker.
  - Ask for real-time feedback: “Did I stay calm in that meeting?” or “Did I explain my ask clearly?”
  - Reward small wins: behavioral change compounds — celebrate consistency over perfection.
Watch out for:
  - Trying to change too many behaviors at once — focus on one or two.
  - Confusing effort with progress — real change shows up in consistent actions over time.

[[/BEHAVIOUR-BASED]]

[[MINDSET-BASED]]

```yaml
name: MINDSET-BASED
category: Development Objectives
version: 1.0
tags: []
```

Definition:
Focus on shifting an underlying belief or perspective that shapes your behaviors and approach. Mindset shifts often unlock multiple behavior or skill improvements at once.
Examples:
  - Move from “asking for help = weakness” to “asking for help = efficiency and collaboration.”
  - Shift from “my lead evaluates me” to “my lead is part of my team.”
  - Replace “I must have the answer” with “I can ask good questions to find the answer.”
  - Adopt a growth mindset: view feedback as learning, not judgment.
Keys to Success:
  - Recognize that mindset change starts with self-awareness — journaling or debriefing with your lead can help uncover thought patterns.
  - Surround yourself with role models who already embody the mindset you want.
  - Look for evidence that challenges your current mindset. (“What happens when I do ask for help early?”)
  - Practice small mindset experiments — try new thinking in a real situation, then reflect on what changed.
  - Be patient — mindset shifts take sustained effort and openness.
Common Tips & Tricks:
  - Reframe limiting thoughts: turn “I don’t want to bother people” into “others appreciate being involved early.”
  - Use reflection prompts:
    - “What story am I telling myself here?”
    - “How would someone with the desired mindset see this situation?”
  - Debrief openly: talk through situations with your lead to spot where the old mindset still shows up.
  - Visualize outcomes: picture yourself operating with the new mindset — what’s different? how does it feel?
Watch out for:
  - Expecting instant change — mindset work is gradual.
  - Doing the reflection alone — outside perspectives help reveal blind spots.

[[/MINDSET-BASED]]

[[EXAMPLE-MILESTONES]]

```yaml
name: EXAMPLE-MILESTONES
category: Example
version: 1.0
tags: []
```


- Milestones with target dates are a critical part of a good Development Plan.
- They provide a chance to check in on direction and appreciate the progress made so far.
- It is common to have a milestone associated with each stage of the Hierarchy of Competence:
  1. Milestone 1 – Consistent Recognition
  2. Milestone 2 – Understand Failure Modes
  3. Milestone 3 – Improved on Failure Modes
  4. Milestone 4 – Improvement Locked In

- You can also have smaller milestones within each of these stages. For example, within "Improved on Failure Modes" you may have a milestone for improving each individual failure mode that is contributing to that Development Objective.
- A typical Development Plan has 3-4 milestones for each Development Objective.
- Example Milestone for Understanding Failure Modes: I can always recognize when I am operating in a failure mode. Upon reflection I can consistently identify gaps between current state and what good would look like.

[[EXAMPLE-DPR-ACTIONS]]

```yaml
name: EXAMPLE-DPR-ACTIONS
category: Example
version: 1.0
tags: []
```


- A Development Plan Review (DPR) is a recurring meeting between a consultant and their lead where they discuss happiness, motivation, workstream progress and their Development Plan.
- The primary outcome of a DPR is to generate specific actions for the consultant to complete over the next two weeks in order to continue progressing against their critical Development Objectives.
- The actions generated in the DPR should be specific, actionable and frequent enough to enable consistent development, even during a busy week.
- It is common for an action to be required daily, weekly or to be triggered on a case by case basis.
- Daily Example: Create a Monday.com log to keep a running log of when you have lost clarity. Get daily feedback from your lead and compare their notes to how you felt in the moment.
- Weekly Example: Each week, define weekly objectives and try to tie them directly to the workstream outcomes. Reserve time in your WSR to get challenge from your lead
